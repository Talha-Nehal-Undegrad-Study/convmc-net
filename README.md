# ConvMC-Net

*ConvMC-Net* takes a single zero matrix as input with the goal to process it in a way that brings it as close to the original matrix as possible. The processing basically involves singular value thresholding (SVT), measurement matrices, and algebraic manipulation to create an update equation for a multi-layer neural network that finally outputs the recovered matrix.
